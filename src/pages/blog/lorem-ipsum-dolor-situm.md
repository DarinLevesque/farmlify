# Scenario

You spend an hour wandering like a zombie through the grocery store aisles placing the best selection of produce that your store has to offer. Then you rush home to finish homework and are unable to make a proper dinner because well....calculus. 

The next day you decide to break into all that "fresh" produce that you bought only to find that much of it is wilted, over ripe or just inedible.

The reason for this is because grocery stores use large, slow distribution centers which take transit time. What commercial farmers are doing in order to waste less is to harvest early which causes this freshness conundrum.

# Why Farmlify

After growing tired of buying produce from the local grocery stores only for that produce to either never ripen correctly, or be over ripe to quickly, we decided that we could create something better. Leverage a highly agile decentralized supply chain which is more mobile, allows for better farmer/consumer relationship (knowing where your food comes from), and ultimately brings the freshest produce straight to your table!
